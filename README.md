Music lovers can never have too much music access. In this app, the user chooses a mood or activity (ex. romance or workout) by clicking on a button. The user will then be brought to a new page to pick a popular genre relating to what mood they chose on the previous page. Once the user clicks the genre button, they will be brought to the third page.

On the third page there will be a play button that will generate a random song that fits into the selected genre. There will also be a search button to look up lyrics of the current song playing. Also on the third page, users have the option to save a liked song with the save track button. Once that is pressed, the user can navigate to the history button on the left side of the page and be taken to their saved songs page.

To make this app, two API's were used.

https://developers.deezer.com/api
Deezer is an API that allows users to use its music catalog.

https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/lyrics-of-a-song/search
Lyrics.ovh is an API powered through Apiary and Oracle that allows users to search for lyrics of songs.

For styling and better UI/UX, materialize and bootstrap frameworks were used. HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery were all used to build this application.
